Many people started a project during the lock-downs due to covid-19
pandemic. In Luxembourg, we got only one and it triggered my long due
bike project. I had two goals, 1) learn basic bike mechanics 2) restore
my teenage bike: a Peugeot Ventoux. Learning by doing is, for me, the
best way. Yes there are tons of youtube videos about everything but
without the real thing to do I have no will to just watch them.

# Peugeot Ventoux

The serial number engraved below the bottom bracket is `Y003 30825`.
Meaning it was built in March 1990. I probably got it in March 1991 and
I remembered reading again and again the bike catalog waiting for my
birthday to come.

The only picture of this catalog that seems relevant online is this one
from the Netherlands:

Mine was yellow / grey and I used until 2010 when I left France. And for
10 years it collected dust in some basements.

In 2020 it looked like this:

Quite a miserable bike, I decided to give it a try bringing back to some
ride-ready state and if I failed it would not harm much.

## Unmounting the bike

I never unmounted a crank set, a cassette nor even a chain. For 20 years I just put 
air in tubes and changed them when got a puncture. Hardly did a maintenance in bike shops neither.
Thinking about it, that was not smart. I might have changed brake pads and oil chain but it sounded like too much work.
I believed in eternal which didn't go wrong while I though this way but really could have been.

## Ordering new wheels

For the wheels, they looked crooked, worn and spokes fragile. So I decided to buy a new set.
It would solved the freewheel issue. The set costs €100 which sounded just fair.

Also add tires and tubes, cheap ones (turned out not great).

## Brakes and tools

Bike tools are cheap and last a lifetime. Should have invested in that way earlier.
Chain whip is easy to use, same for a chain tool. For the crank removal (and bottom bracket),
the main issue is not the price, rather the number of standards.

Here is what I purchased from _Probikeshop_ on the 2020-05-13

| Item                                                    | Quantity | Price (€) |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Two wheels SHIMANO R501 - 10S(56233) Freewheel SHIMANO  | 1        | 102.99    |
| Chain 9S SHIMANO HG53 DEORE / SORA - 116 links          | 1        | 12.49     |
| Shimano PARK TOOL FR-1.3(92114) freewheel               | 1        | 10.49     |
| Chain whip BBB TURNTABLE 10S BTL-11(61856)              | 1        | 14.49     |
| Tires MICHELIN LITHION 2 700x25c                        | 1        | 30.98     |
| Air Tube MICHELIN A1 AIRSTOP BUTYL 700x18/25c           | 2        | 7.98      |
| Two calipers SHIMANO SORA 3000                          | 1        | 30,90     |
| Cable brake Kit and hoose SHIMANO PTFE                  | 1        | 30.90     |
| Bar tape CLASSIC COMFORT                                | 1        |  7.49     |

I ordered new brake calipers as the current **Shimano** _Exage_^[Quoting Shimano "EXAGE, coined from “excellent,” “exceed” and “age”. Most certainly it exceeding its age!] look wasted (see details in the margin).

## Mounting the cassette

Instead of buying a new cassette and chain, I only got a new chain and cleaned the cassette.
Was a lot of work and realized too late, it was totally worn out and we soon damage the brand-new 
chain. But, learning is long process.

## Final result for now

After much cleaning, mounting the wheels, removing the brakes
