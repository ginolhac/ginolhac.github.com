## Headset

In 2020, the headset was serviced minimally and without much knowledge by me.
After unmounting the headset, I cleaned all little balls (lost one!) and mounted back 
with new grease.

In 2023, the up cup made of plastic started to display a crack that became bigger and bigger.
I decided to have done by a professional who changed the full headset, for 19 euros material and 30 for man hour.
Feels much more solid, all metallic cups and new steering feeling.

## Front 105 caliper

Since the rear 105 brought satisfaction, I invested for its complement for the front brake.
Bye bye Sora, you served me well.
