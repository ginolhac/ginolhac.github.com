Briefly, here are the main steps\n\ndownload raspbian lite\nSince I have no screen, no keyboard and the pi comes with a WiFi controller, the stretch lite is sufficient. Image can be found at raspberrypi.org\n\n\nformat SD card\nusing disk utility, choose MS-DOS FAT file system\n\n\ninstall raspbian\nEnsure your SD card is the second disk (/dev/disk2), otherwise do adapt to the correct one!\nunzip 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.zip\nsudo dd bs=1m if=2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2\n\n\nenable ssh\nOnce copied, you can enable ssh by creating an empty file at the SD card root\ncd /Volumes/boot/\ntouch ssh\n\n\nenable wifi\nIn order to connect to the pi without screen / keyboard, wifi needs to be configured right away. At the same location (/Volumes/boot) add a file named wpa_supplicant.conf\nwhich contains:\nnetwork={\n        ssid=\"your_network_ssid\"\n        psk=\"xxx\"\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n}\nOf note, I recently acquired a pi zeroWH, for which I had to add 3 lines (StackExchange question).\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=FR\nnetwork={\n        ssid=\"your_network_ssid\"\n        psk=\"xxx\"\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n}\n\n\nconnect to pi\nonce the raspberrypi booted, try to find its IP\nnmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24\nwhich gives:\nStarting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2017-12-08 22:44 CET\nNmap scan report for 192.168.1.27\nHost is up (0.0071s latency).\nNmap scan report for 192.168.1.254\nHost is up (0.0048s latency).\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 11.71 seconds\n192.168.1.254 was the rooter, so pi was assigned 192.168.1.27\nssh pi@192.168.1.27 works.\nyou can also assign a fixed IP to your pi\n\n\nfinal configuration\nonce connected to the pi:\n\nrun sudo raspi-config to activate the camera\nchange password for the pi user\nset up locales and timezone\nupdate && upgrade raspbian stretch\nadd public ssh key to .ssh/authorized_keys for password less connection"

Hence, the choice of motion\n\nmotion software\nI followed the instructions provided in this great tutorial by Bouvet. With some changes described below.\n\ncompilation\nsee from here https://motion-project.github.io/motion_build.html\nwget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-4.1.1/pi_stretch_motion_4.1.1-1_armhf.deb\nsudo apt-get install gdebi-core\nsudo gdebi pi_stretch_motion_4.1.1-1_armhf.deb\n\n\n\nrun motion\nfirst, as Bouvet suggested, I copied the main config file\nmkdir ~/motion && cp /etc/motion/motion.conf ~/motion/\nand alter the new copy.\nrunning motion:\nmotion -c ~/motion/motion.conf\n\n\ntweaks to the initial tutorial\nI choose to get the videos and several other changes made to the motion version 4.1.1. and are reported in the complete diff page below\ndiff page for motion.conf\nThe initial values are reported in red, in green: the new ones.\n\n\n\nsee live streaming\nwith this configuration, you should see the live streaming from this URL: http://192.168.1.27:8081\nthe web control on port 8080 is disabled apart outside the pi, since we‚Äôll use telegram to control motion\n\n\ndetection\nHere is an example of my kid being detected. The red rectangle works nicely\n\nBut of course, there are false alarms, such as when the light comes in/out suddenly\n\nthe parameter lightswitch 80 reduced the issue but it still exists."

    "text": "Communication with motion via telegram\nNow comes the fun part. Receiving the motion detection by emails is fine, but it can be done via Telegram and the awesome API telepot. Eric told me about telegram bots and it looked promising. Actually, you can even send commands to your pi using your phone using those telegram bots.\nThe useful feature I implemented are:\n\nalerts. A motion is detected. Send the best picture to your telegram account.\npause / resume motion detection. Imagine you are away and for some reason (shadows, your own cat) you keep receiving alerts, you may want to remotely pause the detection. And of course, being able to resume it. Those commands are already in motion, we just need to talk to it.\nstatus. You haven‚Äôt received alerts, is the system running smoothly? You can ask for a confirmation that detection is on. Also, check if the camera is on.\nsnapshot. No alerts, but you‚Äôd like to get a snapshot at any time.\nvideo. Maybe the nicest feature IMHO. Sending picture to your phone for every detection is fine, but not all videos. Based on the picture you see, you‚Äôd like to get the video of the detection. Once again, by a command to a telegram bot, you receive the last video recorded.\n\n\ncreate mybot\nEric gave me the link to this tutorial\nOf course, I am assuming you already have our own telegram account.\nTalk to the BotFather and create mybot, you will receive a private token.\n\n\ninstall telepot\nback on the pi, install telepot with pip, assuming you installed python and pip.\npip install telepot\n\n\ntest sending message\n\nget the bot id\nimport telepot\nbot = telepot.Bot('your-token')\nbot.getMe()\nreturns {u'username': u'mybot', u'first_name': u'cat tracker', u'is_bot': True, u'id': 00000008}\n\n\nget your telegram id:\n\nsend a messages from telegram to mybot\nfetch your message on the pi\n\nfrom pprint import pprint\nresponse = bot.getUpdates()\npprint(response)\nyour id appears, such as: u‚Äôid‚Äô: 00000004\n\n\nbasic tests\n\nfor text\n\nbot.sendMessage(00000004, 'Hey!')\n\nfor picture\n\nbot.sendPhoto(00000004, photo=open('/home/pi/motion/detected/07-2018-01-06_205746-13.jpg', 'rb'), caption='motion detected')\n\n\ncreate commands for the bot\nAfter sending /setcommands to the BotFather:\ntime - Returns current time on pi\ncheck - Returns status of the camera\nstatus - Returns status of motion\npause - Pauses the motion detection\nresume - Resumes motion detection\nsnapshot - Returns current image\nvideo - Returns last recorded video\nOf note, it doesn‚Äôt prevent the bot to receive other commands, it just helps to display commands and select them in telegram.\n\n\npython script that listen\nhere the script listen_bot.py, derived from the telepot documentation.\nSome comments:\n\nthe last video when requested is fetched from the sub-folder vids. If we use the main folder of detection, the last video could be an incomplete one form a newer detection. Hence, the command in motion.conf to move a finished video to the vids folder.\nI failed to restrict the bot to communicate only with me. Might not be a big deal, but the code if chat_id != 00000008 is not working.\nthe webcontrol was set in the RAW mode. Then the retrieved text can be directly send to your telegram account\n\n#!/usr/bin/python2.7\n\nimport datetime\nimport telepot\nimport time\nimport requests\nimport os\nimport glob\nfrom telepot.loop import MessageLoop\n\ndef webcontrol(chat_id, type, cmd):\n    req = 'http://localhost:8080/0/'+type+'/'+cmd\n    res = requests.get(req)\n    bot.sendMessage(chat_id, res.text)\n\ndef handle(msg):\n    chat_id = msg['chat']['id']\n    command = msg['text']\n    #should work thanks to Winston\n    if msg['from']['id'] != 00000008:\n        bot.sendMessage(chat_id, \"Sorry this is a personal bot. Access Denied!\")\n        exit(1)\n\n    print 'Got command: %s' % command\n\n    if command == '/snapshot':\n        requests.get('http://localhost:8080/0/action/snapshot')\n    elif command == '/status':\n        webcontrol(chat_id, 'detection', 'status')\n    elif command == '/pause':\n        webcontrol(chat_id, 'detection', 'pause')\n    elif command == '/resume':\n        webcontrol(chat_id, 'detection', 'start')\n    elif command == '/check':\n        webcontrol(chat_id, 'detection', 'connection')\n    elif command == '/time':\n        bot.sendMessage(chat_id, 'now is '+str(datetime.datetime.now()))\n    elif command == '/video':\n        # the most recent video in this particular folder of complete vids\n        video = max(glob.iglob('/home/pi/motion/detected/vids/*.mp4'), key=os.path.getctime)\n        # send video, adapt the the first argument to your own telegram id\n        bot.sendVideo(00000008, video=open(video, 'rb'), caption='last video')\n    else:\n        bot.sendMessage(chat_id, \"sorry, I don't know the command \"+command)\n# adapt the following to the bot_id:bot_token\nbot = telepot.Bot('0000000004:bot_token')\n\nMessageLoop(bot, handle).run_as_thread()\nprint 'I am listening ...'\n\nwhile 1:\n    time.sleep(10)\nNow if the both listen_bot.py and motion -c ~/motion/motion.conf are running, the system should work.\n\n\nsending scripts\nthey are called in the motion.conf file.\nfirst, send_detection.py\n#!/usr/bin/python2.7\n\nimport telepot\nimport sys\n\nbot = telepot.Bot('0000000004:bot_token')\n\npic = sys.argv[1]\n\n# change caption if it is a snapshot or motion\nif pic.endswith(\"snapshot.jpg\"):\n    cap = 'snapshot'\nelse:\n    cap = 'motion detected'\n\nbot.sendPhoto(00000004, photo=open(pic, 'rb'), caption=cap)\n\nexit(0)\nsecond, send_message.py\n#!/usr/bin/python2.7\n\nimport telepot\nimport sys\n\nbot = telepot.Bot('0000000004:bot_token')\n\ntext = sys.argv[1]\n\nbot.sendMessage(00000004, text)\n\n\nrun scripts at startup\nEdit 2018-06-19\n\nfor listening\nI am now using systemd. Cleaner and safer.\nHere, the following is working, but I am sure this is the right way to do, so use we care.\nadd the file listen.service in the folder /etc/systemd/system:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Listen to foo telegram bot\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/python2.7 -u listen_bot.py\nWorkingDirectory=/home/pi/motion/\nStandardOutput=inherit\nStandardError=inherit\nRestart=always\nUser=motion\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nnow as example, you can check the status of this new service listen\npi@raspberrypi:/etc/systemd/system $ service listen status\n‚óè listen.service - Listen to foo telegram bot\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/listen.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Sun 2018-05-13 21:51:50 CEST; 1 months 6 days ago\n Main PID: 502 (python2.7)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/listen.service\n           ‚îî‚îÄ502 /usr/bin/python2.7 -u listen_bot.py\n\nMay 13 21:51:50 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Started Listen to foo telegram bot.\nMay 13 21:51:51 raspberrypi python2.7[502]: I am listening ...\nJun 19 20:52:17 raspberrypi python2.7[502]: Got command: /time\nAnd, safer since both motion and listen are running as the user motion who does not have sudo rights.\n\n\nFor motion\nI am now using the daemon mode to only benefit from systemd\n\npoint the usual conf file towards the tweaked version in your home\n\ncd /etc/motion\nmv motion.conf motion.conf.bak\nln -s /home/pi/motion/motion.conf .\nbe sure to have the correct smblink\nmotion.conf -&gt; /home/pi/motion/motion.conf\n\n\n\nScreenshots\nHere are some examples of the telegram window\n\nreceived a notification and later on, /check if connection is still on.\n\n\n\nreceived notification and ask for the corresponding video\n\n\nthis video works as a GIF directly in the window:\n\n\n\ngif file\n\n\n\n\npause the detection, and since no motion can be detected, ask for a snapshot\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\nDespite a functional system, some improvements I‚Äôd like to achieve:\n\nrestrict the bot to one user: see Winston Smith recommendation in comments, seems to work nicely\nadd gracefull stop for listen service\nI bought a IP camera, and motion should work with both. Haven‚Äôt spent enough time configuring it\nremove pics/videos older than xx days to save space\nrun the 2 services as a user without sudo rights\nlook into better settings for NoIR camera using this thread"
