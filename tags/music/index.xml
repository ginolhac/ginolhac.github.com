      <description> This page is dedicated to tabs from the band karate made by fans. These tabs came from the original website.
Geoff Farina is the Karate&amp;rsquo;s guitarist, many thanks to him for writing such nice songs. Have fun playing the incredible music made by Karate and please feel free to correct the tabs by sending an email to his author if you find any mistakes or new interpretations.
