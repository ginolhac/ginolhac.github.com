### A bioinformatician versed in {{< fa brands r-project >}}

I am working at the [University of Luxembourg](http://wwwen.uni.lu/); in the [Departement of Life Sciences and Medecine](https://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstm/dlsm), providing services to the researchers.


:::

> I acknowledge that we are in an existential human-induced climate crisis caused by excessive CO2 emissions from a variety of human activities.

>While I recognize that our day-to-day transportation, energy use, materialistic consumption, animal-based diets and excessive flying impact the climate crisis, individual mitigation alone is no substitute for policy reform.

>I acknowledge that the path to resolving this crisis requires systemic societal and structural change supported by strong political intervention rather than individual actions, technological innovation or investment alone.
I acknowledge that we have less than a decade to drastically reduce CO2 emissions to prevent irreparable damage to our quality of life, well-being and the diversity of nature.
